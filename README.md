## What is WindaEDM


![windavdm_logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55901714/166229046-78afaaa5-477a-4509-9fae-dd59b5a2d1d1.jpg)


WindaEDM is an efficient management platform that accurately and effectively helps major enterprises and individuals work together. 

Ok, what does that even mean in the context of managing hospital tools and medical equipment?

Well, those who used [Hospital management tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_information_system) such as MocDoc, Insta, or Attune will be familiarized with this kind of practice. 

But for now, we would like to think of WindaEDM as software that takes care of various activities related to hospital equipment such as requesting maintenance, repairing a machine, data storage/management, stock management, ordering consumables, automated communications, updates, etc.

Why do I need to use this system? 

One of the primary goals of China Care Medical is to improve how your medical equipment is managed and maintained. On top of ensuring that your equipment is well looked after, the software also helps you to keep track of your warehouse stock. It is more like having all the concerned parties such as engineers, manufacturers, sales reps, nurses etc.. right at your fingertip.

## How to download WindaEDM

## How to set it up

#### Change your Language


First thing first you need to change your language. For now, the app supports only English and Chinese languages.
While on the App(before logging in), find at the bottom of your screen the setting icon ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55901714/166923715-2cdbdcb3-c477-4ade-b738-d28ecd29dea0.png) and tap on it.

Choose your desired language, for English tap on English as illustrated below.

#### How to use WindaEDM as a Nurse

First, you need to get your credentials from your manager or the service provider (in this case China Care Medical).
That will include the Organization name, Username, and password as illustrated bellow

That should take you to a screen like the one shown below.

![0fbc2c48-ca74-4fe4-a424-e8d31116fafd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55901714/166927341-52123dcc-ecb9-4f59-adae-80c2735f4945.jpg)


A nurse has limited responsibilities compared to the Hospital manager or boss.
Let's navigate through the App and experiment with some of the tasks a nurse or a laboratory assistant could do on the app.

##### Report broken machine or request maintenance service.

⚠️ The page might take a while to load depending on your device's space memory and RAM. Please be patient. in some instances, you might need to close the app and other running apps to free up the memory.
 
 To let the engineer know about a broken machine and request maintenance the user needs just to scan the QR associated with the machine they want to report. The QR code will usually be on one side of the machine as a sticker. Find it and scan it using the WindaEDM scanner as shown in the illustration below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55901714/166929317-e54c2b74-552d-4b39-b132-3192f57d2564.png)

next scan the QR code of the machine you want to report.
If you can't find a QR code ask the supplier(China Care Medical) to provide a QR code. 

For illustration purpose use this [QR CODE](https://github.com/py-tony/how-to-use-the-windaedm-assistant-from-china-care-medical/blob/main/9443e0de-3f17-417b-8e6b-b8b43185e2ae.jpg)

![432efcdf-8b8e-4b74-ab2f-a0fcad36dcec](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55901714/166931640-11f22142-1f90-4ae7-9f15-9e8dfb0e683e.jpg)

You will be redirected to a page that will look like the one below. The data on this page are just basic information related to the machine. Please go ahead and press on Report.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55901714/166944525-1a7af72c-db16-41d8-a265-5913ea1702fc.png)

Next locate the `State`, `Prioriity`, and `Report Description` sections. 
Start by entering the state of the machine. this is where you let the maintenance team about the current state of the machine and determine how urgent the issue needs to be addressed. 

Click on State ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55901714/166948266-58d75113-0b64-4bfd-9013-ea0b79bd2ad8.png) scoll up or down to select the state that the machine is currently in and make sure to confirm the change. See the example below.


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55901714/166948061-3520b5f5-fd7e-4616-9100-67663d81a126.png)

Do the same with Priority by tapping on `Priority`. This is just to notify the technician of how urgent this needs to be addressed.
1) General
2) Serious
3) Urgent

Next fill in the `Report Description`. This is where you tell us more about what is wrong with the machine and extra information that you noticed previously.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55901714/167038542-2470d8a2-29dc-4c8f-82a1-89566f8891fb.png)


Noticed that you can also 1) add a voice note or 2) take a pic to describe the problem in detail. Once you're happy with the info provided, 3) press `Confirm` as shown below.

Congratulations! you've just learned how to report a problem that you might experience with China Care Medical machines.

Next, let's see how a nurse can apply for new consumables. The steps are done as follows: Nurse applies for new consumables ---> Hospital Warehouse manager gets application---> Nurse go to pick ----> Warehouse manager scan it, then Stockout. 

These operations, including the maintenance report, are done under the supervision of the general manager or the boss of the hospital. That way, the hospital boss can know clearly what items are still left in their warehouse, who applied them, and when the stock almost run out to place more orders for consumables to prevent stock shortages. 


Ready? let's do it! 


### Nurse how to apply for new consumables 

From your home screen... 
1) Find the `Parts` icon on the bottom navbar and tap on it. 
2) Tap on the `Picking` button as illustrated below.

On the Picking page, you will see previous picking order or request that is pending confirmation or confirmed. 
Next, press the blue icon with the plus sign (+) at the bottom of your screen.
