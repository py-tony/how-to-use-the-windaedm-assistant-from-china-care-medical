WindaEDM is an efficient management equipment platform that accurately and effectively helps major enterprises and individuals work together. 

Ok, what does that even mean in the context of managing hospital tools and medical equipment?
Well, those who used [Hospital management tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_information_system) such as MocDoc, Insta, or Attune will be familiarized with this kind of practice. But for now, we would like to think of WindaEDM as software that takes care of various activities in a hospital such as requesting maintenance, repair of a machine, data storage/management, stock management, automated communications, or updates.

Why do I need to use this system? The primary goal of this App is to improve how your medical equipment is managed and looked after. On top of ensuring that your equipment is well looked after, the software also helps you to keep track of your warehouse stock. It is more like having all the concerned parties such as engineers, manufacturers, sales reps, nurses etc.. right at your fingertip.
